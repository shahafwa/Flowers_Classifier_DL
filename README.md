# Deep Learning Project for Udacity NanoDegree(Pytorch)
## Project: Flower Classifier

### Description
In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.


**Target**
- `class`: Classifying each flower

**Usage**
Train a new network on a data set with train.py

Basic usage: python train.py data_directory
Prints out training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains
Options:
Set directory to save checkpoints: python train.py data_dir --save_dir save_directory
Choose architecture: python train.py data_dir --arch "vgg13"
Set hyperparameters: python train.py data_dir --learning_rate 0.01 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 20
Use GPU for training: python train.py data_dir --gpu
Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name. That is, you'll pass in a single image /path/to/image and return the flower name and class probability.

Basic usage: python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint
Options:
Return top KK most likely classes: python predict.py input checkpoint --top_k 3
Use a mapping of categories to real names: python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_to_name.json
Use GPU for inference: python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu
